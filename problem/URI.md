URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a compact string used to identify or name resources on the Internet. Some examples of URI are below:

http://icpc.baylor.edu.cn/
mailto:foo@bar.org
ftp://127.0.0.1/pub/linux
readme.txt
When transmitting *URI*s through the Internet, we escape some special characters in *URI*s with percent-encoding. Percent-encoding encodes an ASCII character into a percent sign ("%") followed by a two-digit Hexadecimal representation of the ASCII number. The other characters are not touched in the encoding process. The following table shows the special characters and their corresponding encodings:

| Special Character | Encoded String |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| " " |	%20 |
| "!" |	%21 |
| "$" |	%24 |
| "%" |	%25 |
| "("	| %28 |
| ")" |	%29 |
| "*" |	%2a |

Note that the quotes are for clarity only.

Write a program which reverses this process.

##입력

The first line of the input file will contain the number of test cases C (1≤C≤100). The following C lines will each contain a test case — which is the percent-encoded URI. Their length will be at most 80.

##출력

Print one line for each test cases — the decoded original URI.
